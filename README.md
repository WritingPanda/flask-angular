## Flask-Angular

A place to learn and experiment with Flask, AngularJS, and PostgreSQL.

Here is what I am building: A Flask app that calculates word-frequency pairs based on the text from a given URL.

I am learning this stuff while on vacation in China as of April 15. 

Do developers often think about coding while on vacation? I don't know.

I am using this website to guide my learning: [Flask by Example: Flask and Angular](https://realpython.com/blog/python/flask-by-example-integrating-flask-and-angularjs/).

Feel free to follow along if you like!

I am using `virtualenv` and `virtualenvwrapper` to facilitate my virtual environment.

**Python 3.4** is being used, as per the tutorial.
